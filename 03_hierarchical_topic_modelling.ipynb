    "In this notebook we're going to expand our previous topic modelling approaches in order to model hierarchic topics.\n",
    "Even though a single level topic modelling is helpful to go over the vast amount of papers in the CORD-19 dataset, our hypothesis is that a hierarchical topic modelling will provide a much more easier way to sway through the papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following references have caught our attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/hdpmodel.html: an implementation of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP) using the topic modelling library `gensim`.\n",
    "- https://github.com/joewandy/hlda: an implementation of Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) in Python.\n",
    "- https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/128/latent-dirichlet-allocation-vs-hierarchical-dirichlet-process: a comparison between LDA and HDP.\n",
    "- https://developer.squareup.com/blog/inferring-label-hierarchies-with-hlda/: a write up about Square's experience using hLDA to hierarchically classify customer support articles.\n",
    "- https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2017/4382348/: a journal article.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA models documents as Dirichlet mixtures of a fized number of topics, which are modelled as Dirichlet mixtures of words.\n",
    "hLDA is an adaptation of LDA that models topics as a mixture of a new, distinct level of topics.\n",
    "HDP main difference with respecto to LDA is that the number of topics isn't an hyperparamenter, but is discarded because it doesn't build a hierarchical topic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first try a hierarchical topic modelling using hLDA and then we'll compare it to a manual LDA hierarchical modelling."
