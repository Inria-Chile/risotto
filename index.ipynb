    "\n",
    "The [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) research effort is generating a massive amount of information that is reported as research papers. Traditional human-annotated, ontology-based or supervised (tag-based) learning NLP methods are not able to handle the task of supporting research and understanding results adequately.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a research support tool that exploits the current state of the art of unsupervised learning in NLP that could be used to provide a quick response to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "RISOTTO is a research support tool that applies state of the art unsupervised NLP and ML methods to:\n",
    "- analyze COVID-19-related research papers freely available online,\n",
    "- automatically detect hierarchical groups of these papers and topics,\n",
    "- present leading \"popular\" papers as well as potential breakthroughs and new results, and\n",
    "- provide a visualization tool to understand how is the progress doing what areas are receiving more attention in time, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, use as input the research papers that have been consolidated as the [CORD-19 dataset](https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19) by the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org) and collaborating institutions. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** It is expected that, as we progress on the conception and development of this tool new tasks/tools will be added to this list.\n",

    "* Do not add/remove vertical whitespace. Preserve the original style of the file you edit as much as you can.\n",
    "* Do not turn an already submitted PR into your development playground. If after you submitted PR, you discovered that more work is needed - close the PR, do the required work and then submit a new PR. Otherwise each of your commits requires attention from maintainers of the project.\n",
    "* If, however, you submitted a PR and received a request for changes, you should proceed with commits inside that PR, so that the maintainer can see the incremental fixes and won't need to review the whole PR again. In the exception case where you realize it'll take many many commits to complete the requests, then it's probably best to close the PR, do the work and then submit it again. Use common sense where you'd choose one way over another.\n",
